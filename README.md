Instructions:

- Construct a single page doctor locator with a UI similar to:

https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/162BUEWsUw-rpaWe2eVRe9cdcCBJEb6LtQvu-4wfc0oQ/edit?usp=sharing .

- summary.json should be used in place of what an API would return.

Requirements:

- The UI layout should follow the mock.

- When a doctor is selected, something should change on the map (ex: zoom to doctor's pin, highlight pin).

- The final product should be a public github repo.

We're looking for clean, well-tested code. Tests should cover functionality rather than methods.
